## HTML Table

### `<table>`

It is used to represent data in a table. A table contains rows and columns, and each cell contains data. The `<tr>` element defines the table row. It may contain `<th>` (cells that contain header) or `<td>` (cells that contain data). `<thead>` element defines a set of rows indicating the head of the table. `<tbody>` element defines a set of rows indicating the body of the table.

**Attributes of &lt;table&gt; element:**

*   `<align>` : It defines where the table will be displayed on the screen. It has three values -
